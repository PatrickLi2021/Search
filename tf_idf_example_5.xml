    <page>
        <title>Hello</title>
        <id>1</id>
        <text>hello is such an interesting word. for example, look at [[Goodbye|this]]
        </text>
    </page>
    <page>
        <title>bye</title>
        <id>2</id>
        <text>bye is also a super interesting word. but, it means something different from hello.
        for instance, have a glance at this page [[see you later | hello, click this]]
